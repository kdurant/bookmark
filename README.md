# About
I package some no update plugins into my repo!

* [AuthorInfo](https://github.com/vim-scripts/AuthorInfo),

* [star-search](https://github.com/vim-scripts/star-search)

* [cmdline-completion](https://github.com/vim-scripts/cmdline-completion)

* [verilog.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/verilog.vim)

Because update this plugin use `vim-plum` is waste times.
